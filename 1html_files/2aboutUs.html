<h2>Addressing the Escalating Issue of Child Marriages in Niger</h2>

<p style="color: black;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;font-size: larger;">
    In recent years, Niger has witnessed an alarming surge in the prevalence of child marriages. As a consequence, Rujeko has undertaken a crucial mission to rescue and provide shelter for these vulnerable girls. However, the endeavor has encountered significant obstacles due to the scarcity of donations. Consequently, a concerted effort is being made to prioritize farming activities as a means to sustain the mission's objectives.
